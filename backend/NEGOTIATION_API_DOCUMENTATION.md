## Message Types

The negotiation system creates special message types in conversations:

- `negotiation_proposal`: Initial or counter-proposal
- `negotiation_accepted`: Proposal accepted
- `negotiation_declined`: Proposal declined
- `negotiation_cancelled`: Negotiation cancelled

## Real-time Events

The system emits Socket.IO events for real-time updates:

- `negotiation_created`: New negotiation created
- `negotiation_proposal`: New proposal made
- `negotiation_accepted`: Proposal accepted
- `negotiation_declined`: Proposal declined
- `negotiation_cancelled`: Negotiation cancelled

## Business Rules

1. **Proposal Limits**: Maximum 10 proposals per negotiation (configurable)
2. **Consecutive Proposals**: Users cannot make consecutive proposals
3. **Self-Response**: Users cannot accept/decline their own proposals
4. **Auto-Expiration**: Negotiations can auto-expire after 7 days (configurable)
5. **Role Validation**: Only organizers and speakers can participate
6. **Conversation Access**: Users must be participants in the conversation

## Error Responses

### 400 Bad Request
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "An active negotiation already exists for this conversation"
}
```

### 403 Forbidden

  "message": "Access denied to this negotiation"

}
```

## Integration with Messaging System

The negotiation system is fully integrated with the messaging system:

1. **Conversation Creation**: Negotiations are tied to existing conversations
2. **Message Integration**: All negotiation actions create corresponding messages
3. **Real-time Updates**: Socket.IO events keep all participants updated
4. **Unread Counts**: Negotiation messages contribute to unread counts
5. **Search**: Negotiation messages are searchable through the messaging search API

## Security Features

1. **JWT Authentication**: All endpoints require valid JWT tokens
2. **Role-based Access**: Only organizers and speakers can participate
3. **Conversation Validation**: Users must be participants in the conversation
4. **Proposal Validation**: Business rules prevent invalid proposals
5. **Audit Trail**: All proposals and responses are logged with timestamps
